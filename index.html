"Respected sir/ma’am, %0D%0A%0D%0A\
I am writing this to express my discontent and dissent regarding the decisions taken by Karnataka State Law University, Hubli and Bar Council of India with respect to our previous semester examination.%0D%0A%0D%0A\
A physical examination would compel the students to travel inter-state amid the pandemic, share rooms with other students in hostels, and make arrangements for food. Permitting an offline examination and asking students to appear for the exams, would amount to directly exposing them to danger and risk to their health and lives. Karnataka State Law University (KSLU) is a large university with over 106 colleges consisting of a majority of outstation students and even students from foreign countries. KSLU semester exams is a series of exams and if a student, even after going through the ordeal of arriving for physical exams, gets infected with the COVID-19 deadly virus in between the physical exams will not be able to attend the remaining exams, thus making his/ her efforts futile. Most COVID patients in Karnataka are home treated and a student staying in a hostel, hotel, PG, flat etc will not be able to even get this basic home treatment if the student gets infected. So, the decision of the Karnataka State Law University to not follow safe methods of evaluation that ensure a student will not have to choose between his/her Right to Life and Right to Education and trying to repeatedly and cruelly enforce an old normal that is clearly unsafe in the present pandemic situation has to be assumed as a decision with ulterior motives without keeping in mind, the best interest of students. I even believe that the reason KSLU is insisting on conducting a physical examination in such adverse circumstances is because any other alternative would be more transparent. There is a fundamental difference between going out and putting your life in danger to earn your livelihood and paying exam fees and going out to put your life in danger. Therefore, I as a student of KSLU strongly condemn the decision of the KSLU and BCI to conduct offline physical examinations during the pandemic, which is coercing me into sacrificing my Right to Life. Should the integrity of Right to Life be compromised for the integrity of Right to Education? Especially, when other universities of this same country is guaranteeing the students their Right to Education along with their Right to Life through alternative evaluation mechanisms such as 50-50 evaluation mechanism, assignment submission evaluation, Open Book online Exams, Vivas conducted through online platform etc. The pandemic situation is continuing to exist unprecedentedly and it becomes very wrong to try and enforce physical attendance that is proven as unsafe and it becomes imperative that the Karnataka State Law University (KSLU) comes up with a new safer alternative than asking me to compromise my Right to Life repeatedly every semester.%0D%0A%0D%0A\
The KSLU not giving an option of online examination for its students who are not able to attend physical exam even after the BCI circular dated 01/11/2020 which allows a University to conduct online test, is only adding to this prejudice and injustice against law students.  Delhi University and many other universities have already conducted open book online tests, such as question paper being given through Whatsapp or e-mail and students being allowed to handwrite or type the answers and submit answer sheets within a prescribed time, along with the option of physical exams thereby letting a student choose what mode of examination he/she wants to undertake. At this juncture, it is to be noted that the BCI notice of 01/11/2020 says “examination for all intermediary along with final year law students/classes too may be held online, if Universities/Law Colleges are able to hold it online, and if adequate infrastructure and other facilities for students is/are available.” Therefore conduction of a online test can be done if students have the infrastructure/ facilities for it and this is rightly put by the BCI since conduction of an online test in the above stated tried and tested method does not require any extra infrastructure facilities from the side of the university that a university normally does not possess, and only requires online facilities on the side of the students. It is also to be noted that online internal tests have already been held in many colleges including my own college and there has been overwhelming attendance in every college for the same, since an online test requires much less online facility requirement from a student as compared to a daily online class. It is also to be noted that KSLU has been conducting online classes and this proves that KSLU has the ability to conduct an online test. The online test conducted by Delhi University, which consists of many students from remote areas of the country had an attendance of over 97%. It is also to be noted that evaluation through assignment submission is also a tried and tested method in many universities across the country with every student being able to compete since this requires very minimal online requirement from a student. %0D%0A%0D%0A\
BCI has already admitted in their press release dated 01/11/2020 that they were short-sighted in their order dated 27/05/2020. The press release of BCI dated 01/11/2020 is another such short-sighted communication because the BCI is only looking at the previous semester evaluation and does not speak anything about the current semester evaluation. BCI press release says that, students who don't write the examination now, a physical examination can be conducted for them when the normalcy returns and the pandemic situation does not exist anymore and that is something which is certainly not going to happen before our present semester examination which is ordinarily scheduled in the month of December and most of the universities across the country ordinarily have their present semester examination in the month of November or December. The students cannot be expected to keep on storing the examinations for different semesters and then write 2,3 semester exams (compiling to 15-20 papers) at one go when the pandemic situation is over. This would also result in a law student that is not able to attend the physical exam during the pandemic, due to no fault of his/her own, only completing his/her course around a year after whenever the course ordinarily would finish. This will be huge prejudice and injustice towards such students.%0D%0A%0D%0A\
Students after being promoted to next semester are required to familiarize with the new curriculum which involves fresh subjects and topics, do various assignments, end term examination and other activities including writing semester projects for each subject and their oral presentation, backlog exams and internship, seminar, moot court etc. A student of law in KSLU studies 5 to 6 law subjects each semester and it is humanly impossible to take the burden of three different semesters comprising around 15 -20 law papers in this short period of time. This will have a damaging impact on the mental health of the students and will also impact their result in the semester examination and future career prospects. %0D%0A%0D%0A\
The BCI guideline which the KSLU is implementing is not relevant now and does not, anymore, hold good in law. Because STUDENTS CANNOT BE ASKED TO WRITE EXAMINATION FOR SUBJECTS WHICH THEY WERE TAUGHT ALMOST A YEAR AGO.  After reopening of college, when normalcy returns if remedial/revision classes are conducted (for 45 days to 2 months as declared by the law minister through a press conference dated 26th August 2020 after a state wide protest) and thereafter an examination for even semester of 2019-2020 academic year is conducted, the 2020-2021 academic year will collapse. %0D%0A%0D%0A\
The Government of Karnataka vide its order no. ED/197/UNE/2020 dated 10/07/2020 mandated all the universities in the state to evaluate its intermediate year students under a mechanism where 50 percentage weightage would be given to previous academic performance and 50 percentage weightage would be given to internal assessment. A similar proposal can also be traced in the UGC guidelines of examination. But due to the communications made by Bar Council of India, KSLU has not implemented GOK order dated 10/07/2020 and has started a new academic year keeping our previous semester evaluation as due. In a health emergency situation like this when student community at large is affected by the pandemic, an evaluation scheme, brought to protect the students’ interest and which is being followed by the entire country, should, indiscriminately, be extended to the law students of KSLU as well so as to avoid an unreasonable classification as prohibited by Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The course of Law is a multidisciplinary course and students of law will compete with students from other universities and other fields of study, in their academic as well as professional career. Therefore, if a different method of evaluation is adopted only for the law students, it will cause disparity among law students and non-law students.%0D%0A%0D%0A\
Many premier law universities/law colleges ( Universities of Maharashtra, Universities of Tamil Nadu, Ambedkar Law University, Institute Of Law, Nirma University, Reva University Bangalore, Christ University Bangalore, Maharashtra National Law University, National Law University Odisha, Chanakya National Law University, Patna, Jindal Global Law School etc, Calcutta University etc.) in Karnataka and in other parts of the country, have not complied with the direction of BCI and has adopted alternative evaluation mechanism such as evaluation based on assignment submission, online tests, 50-50 comprehensive method etc, for its intermediate year students.%0D%0A%0D%0A\
It is to be noted that I, as a stakeholder and as a KSLU student, feel and is sure of the fact that evaluation through 50-50 comprehensive method is the only way my future and life will be secured completely with the least damage to my Academic Calendar, like students of other courses all across India and like other Law University students such as Ambedkar Law University, Universities in Maharashtra etc. However, it is also to be noted that I am not afraid of tests since I have been writing tests all my life and will attend any safer alternative test other than a physical test that does not coerce me into having to choose between my Right to Life and Right to Education. The purpose of education itself is the welfare of students and any decision taken against the welfare of students defeats the purpose of education.%0D%0A%0D%0A\
Therefore, in the light of the above I am requesting the authorities concerned to either evaluate the intermediate semester law students of Karnataka State Law University in the comprehensive formula (50:50) as proposed by the government of Karnataka Order no. ED/197/UNE/2020 dated 10.07.2020 or to conduct any other alternative mode of evaluation other than a physical examination during the pandemic thereby upholding my rights.%0D%0A%0D%0A\
Yours sincerely,%0D%0A"+student
