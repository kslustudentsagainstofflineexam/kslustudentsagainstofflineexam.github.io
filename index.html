ED/197/UNE/2020 dated 10.07.2020 or through any other alternative mode of evaluation other than a physical examination.  &body=\
FROM,%0D%0A\
Name of Student/ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಯ ಹೆಸರು : " + student + "%0D%0A" +
"Name of the College/ ಕಾಲೇಜಿನ ಹೆಸರು : " + college + "%0D%0A" + 
"Current Semester/ ಪ್ರಸ್ತುತ ಸೆಮಿಸ್ಟರ್ : " + year + "%0D%0A%0D%0A" + 
"Respected sir/ma’am, %0D%0A%0D%0A\
I am writing this to express my discontent regarding the decisions taken by Karnataka State Law University, Hubli and Bar Council of India with respect to our previous semester examination. %0D%0A%0D%0A" +  

"The Government of Karnataka vide its order no. ED/197/UNE/2020 dated \
10.07.2020 mandated all the universities in the state to evaluate its \
intermediate semester students under a mechanism where 50% weightage \
would be in previous academic performance and 50% weightage would be \
in internal assessment. " +  "A similar proposal can also be traced in the \
UGC guidelines of examination. But due to a communication made by Bar \
Council India, the university has not implemented this scheme and has \
started a new academic year keeping our previous semester evaluation \
is due. %0D%0A%0D%0A" + 
"In a health emergency situation like this when student community at \
large is affected by the pandemic, an examination scheme, brought to \
protect the students’ interest and which is being followed by the \
entire country, should indiscriminately be extended to the law \
students of KSLU as well so as to avoid an unreasonable classification \
as prohibited by article 14 of the Constitution of India. The course \
of Law is a multidisciplinary course and students of law will compete \
with students from other universities and other fields of study, in \
their academic as well as professional career. Therefore, if a \
different method of evaluation is adopted only for the law students, \
it will cause disparity among law students and non-law students. %0D%0A%0D%0A" + 
"Students after being promoted to next semester would be required \
familiarise with the new Curriculum which involves fresh subjects and \
topics, do various assignments, end term Examination and other \
activities including writing semester projects for each subject and \
their oral presentation, Backlog Exams and internship, seminar, moot \
court etc. A student of law in KSLU studies 5 to 6 law subjects each \
semester and it is humanly impossible to take the burden of three \
different semesters comprising around 15 -20 law papers in this short \
period of time. This will have a damaging impact on the mental health \
of the students and will also impact their result in the semester \
examination and future career prospects. %0D%0A%0D%0A" + 
"The BCI guideline which the KSLU is implementing is outdated now and \
does not anymore hold good in law. after reopening of college if \
remedial classes (for 45 days to 2 months as declared by the law \
minister through press conference) and an examination for even \
semester of 2019-2020 academic year is conducted, the 2020-2021 \
academic year will collapse. %0D%0A%0D%0A" + 
"Many premier law universities/law colleges (Institute Of Law, Nirma \
University, Reva University Bangalore, Christ University Bangalore, \
Maharashtra National Law, National Law University Odisha, Chanakya \
National Law University, Patna, Jindal Global Law School etc.) in \
Karnataka and in other parts of the country, have not complied with \
this direction of BCI and has adopted alternative evaluation \
mechanism.%0D%0A%0D%0A" + 
"Moreover, a physical examination would compel the students to travel \
inter-state amid the virus, share rooms with other students in \
hostels, and make arrangements for food. Permitting an offline \
examination and asking students to appear for the exams, would amount \
to directly exposing them to danger and risk to their health and \
lives. So, the decision of the Karnataka State Law University to not \
follow safe methods of evaluation that ensure a student will not have \
to choose between his/her Right to Life and Right to Education and \
trying to repeatedly and cruelly enforce an old normal that is clearly \
unsafe in the present pandemic situation has to be assumed as a \
decision with ulterior motives without keeping in mind, the best \
interest of students. Therefore, I as a student of KSLU hereby \
strongly condemn the decision of the KSLU to conduct offline physical \
examinations, which are coercing me into sacrificing my Right to Life. %0D%0A%0D%0A" + 
"There is no certainty as to when the college can reopen physically, \
when normalcy returns and when the pandemic situation does not exist \
anymore, and the current semester examination also needs to be \
conducted which is ordinarily scheduled in the month of December. %0D%0A%0D%0A" + 
"Therefore in the light of the above I am requesting the authorities \
concerned to evaluate the intermediate semester law students of \
Karnataka State Law University under the comprehensive formula (50:50) \
as proposed by the government of Karnataka order no. ED/197/UNE/2020 \
dated 10.07.2020 or through any other alternative mode of evaluation \
other than a physical examination.%0D%0A%0D%0A" + "Yours sincerely"
